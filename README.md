## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

In this project, I created a machine learning model capable of classifying "expoplanets" from the data set at hand. I preprocessed the data, tuned the models, and comapred the models.

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)


### Steps I took to Preprocess the data:

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.
